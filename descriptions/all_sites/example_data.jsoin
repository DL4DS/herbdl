Plants bloom on the previous season's wood so late winter pruning will prevent blooms. Native HabitatNative to central China. Zones 4-8.\nGrowth HabitLarge growing shrub, 6-10' tall and wide.Upright arching habit, multistemmed providing a vase or fountain-like effect. Can become leggy with age and benefits from pruning to help improve form.\nLeavesDark green, ovate with an acuminate tip, opposite.

Zones 4-8.\nGrowth HabitEastern redbud is grown as a single or multi-trunked small tree growing 20-30' tall by 25-35' wide. Shape is rounded to flat topped with branching upright to spreading. The main trunk is generally short with branching close to the ground.\nLeavesLeaves are heart shaped growing 3-5\" long and wide and are alternate.Leaves emerge bright green maturing to dark green. Fall color is yellow to yellow-green.\nBark and StemsStems have a distinct zig-zag growth pattern.Older branches can have somewhat exfoliating bark with dark brown outer and orange-brown inner bark.\nFlowersThe main ornamental feature are the small purple-pink pea-like flowers in clusters of 4-8 that emerge in late April to early May before the foliage emerges.Flowers can occur directly on branches and trunksHeavy blooming.\nFruit2-3\" long flattened pods that emerge green, turning brown as they mature.Can be numerous.\nBloom TimeSpring; late April - early May\nCommon ProblemsWinter dieback can be a problem in zone 4 and 5.Can be short-lived.Canker can be a significant disease issue. Verticillium wilt, leaf spots, mildew, blights, Japanese beetles, leaf hoppers, caterpillars, borers, webworms, and scale can be problems. \nVarieties or Cultivars'Forest Pansy' - purple leaved cultivar.

Native habitats is moist woods and stream banks.\nGrowth HabitUpright, spreading, multi-stemmed shrub growing 4-6' tall (sometime 8') with equal spread.\nLeavesThe common name oakleaf comes from the resemble of leaves to those of the oak. Leaves and large with 3-7 lobes and dark green. Fall color is red to purple.\nBark and StemsBark is exfoliating. Providing ornamental interest.\nFlowersPyramidal panicles of white flowers in summer\nBloom TimeSummer. Flowering occurs for 6-8 weeks.\nCommon ProblemsNo serious insect or disease problems. Can have leaf blight or powdery mildew. \nVarieties or CultivarsAmethyst - upright, 6\" long inflorescences. Sepals turn red. Compact form growing 5-6 foot tall and wide.Brido - Snowflake: double white flowers. 5-8 foot tall and wide. Queen of Hearts: large, upright flower panicles up to 9\" long. Open white gradually age to a deep pink. Bloom later than most other oakleafs. Pee Wee: compact size growing 3-4 foot tall and 3 foot wide. Smaller overall size, leaves, and flowers.Ruby Slippers: compact form growing 3-4 foot tall and 3-5 foot wide. Large upright panicles of white flowers mature to ruby red.\nRelated SpeciesHydrangea macrophyllaHydrangea paniculata\nLandscape UsesGood specimen or foundation plant. Also good in mass. Multiseason plant with summer flowers, good fall color, and interesting bark in winter. More compact cultivars are good for near building or patios. \n"

Dappled shade is preferred; full sun may result in leaf scorch. Should be sited in areas protected from strong winter winds. PJM should not be planted in wet areas as root rot can be an issue, but also should not be allowed to dry out. Mulching helps to maintain soil moisture. Hardy to zone 4; good winter hardiness.Native HabitatThe PJM group is a group of Rhododendron hybrids resulting from crosses between R. Carolinianum and R. dauricum var. sempervirens. The original breeding for this group of hybrids was done at Weston Nurseries by Edmund and Peter J. Mezitt. \nGrowth HabitCompact, rounded growing 3-6' tall and wide.\nLeavesDark green, hairless leaves are elliptical in shape growing 1-2.5\" long. Evergreen, stiff, leathery leaves with a rusty-orange, scaly underside.Has a purple-green color in winter.\nFlowersBright lavender pink flowers in clusters of 4-9. \nBloom TimeSpring; April\nCommon ProblemsSimilar to other Rhododendrons PJM hybrids are susceptible to various issues including canker, crown rot, root rot, leaf spot, rust, powdering mildew, aphids, borers, lacebugs, mealybugs, mites, scale, thrips, and whitefly.Properly sited plants have few problems.\nVarieties or CultivarsPJM Compact - similar to PJM but with larger flowers. Upright and spreading.'PJM Compact Briggs' - lavender pink, smaller habit'PJM Lavender' - lavender pink flowers; early flowering; winter leaves reddish-brown; semi-dwarf'PJM White Form' - white flowered form\nLandscape UsesGood for shrub borders, woodland and shade gardens, or for foundation plantings.
